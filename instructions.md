# Soil respiration reporting format instructions

A data package containing soil respiration data must include, at a minimum: 

1. Assemble the data table, using the standard **[variableNames and variableUnits]**. 

2. Fill in the **[Methods metadata template]**, ensuring that **[required protocols]** for each data type are described. See our **[methods metadata guide]** for descriptions and instructions for each metadata field. Save as csv file type. A separate methods metadata file should be created for each data type included in the data package. 

4. Fill in the **[Instrument details template]** and save as csv file type.

## Additional information
Inclusion of additional related datasets with soil respiration data is encouraged. This can include measurements made inline, such as soil moisture or temperature, or subsequent analysis of chemical composition or physical properties. Related data should be linked by using common sample identifiers. 

Defined variables should be used where available. For variables not yet covered by this reporting format documentation, data contributors should use machine readable variable names that are in common use. 

We will continue to work with the ESS community to improve data and metadata reporting formats for soil respiration data. Please [contribute](contribute.md) by submitting issues, using our issue templates, or contact ess-dive-support@lbl.gov to provide any feedback on the process of formatting data or specific metadata fields.
